This directory is intended to contain code for projects that use Umple but are not
part of the Umple project itself.

We invite people to create their own Umple examples, including proper test cases. 
These test cases can be built automatically, helping us ensure that updates to 
the compiler don’t break your code. They also serve as additional test cases for us.
