@@description
<p><a href="BasicStateMachines.html">State machine</a> event methods are generated automatically from a state machine.
Sometimes a programmer wants to execute some code whenever a given event is processed by a state machine, no matter what state the state machine is in.
</p>

<p>Code can be injected before or after any event, as shown in the example below. Note that in the case of <a href="QueuedStateMachines.html">queued</a> or <a href="PooledStateMachines.html">pooled state machines</a>, the injected code will only be triggered when the event is actually processed by the state machine (i.e. when it is removed from the queue).
