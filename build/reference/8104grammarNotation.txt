<p>
In Umple we use our own extended EBNF syntax for the grammar, with our own parsing tool. The reason for this is that we wanted several advanced features in the grammar and parser.
</p>

<p>
Samples of syntax in this user manual are generated directly from the input grammar files
used to parse Umple code.
</p>

<p>
Our syntax offers a very simple mechanism to define a new language,
as well as extend an existing one.  We will be using examples to 
help explain our syntax.
</p>




&nbsp;<br/>
<h2>Example of a simple rule</h2>

<p>Let's start with a simple assignment rule (not part of Umple, just an example):</p>
<pre class="x">assignment : [name] = [value] ;</pre>

<p>
Above, the rule name is "assignment".  An assignment is comprised of 
a non-terminal called "name", then the equals symbol ("="), a non-terminal "value" and 
finally a semi-colon symbol (";").
</p>

<p>
A <b>non-terminal</b> by default as shown above is a sequence of <b>characters</b> that is a <b>non-whitespace</b> that is 
delimited by the next <b>symbol</b> (based on the specified grammar). In the above case, the non-terminal "name"
will be defined by the characters leading up to either a space, newline,
or an equals ("=").
</p>

<p>
Here are a few examples that satisfy the assignment rule above:
</p>


<ul>
<li><font color="green">key = "one";</font></li>
<li><font color="green">wasSet=true;</font></li>
<li><font color="green">numberOfItems =7;</font></li>
</ul>


&nbsp;<br/>
<h2>Rules that refer to other rules</h2>

<p>Let us now consider nesting sub-rules within a rule. Sub-rules are words between [[ and ]]. Again, the following is illustrative, and is not Umple itself</p>

<pre class="x">
directive- : [[facadeStatement]] | [[useStatement]]<br />
facadeStatement- : [=facade] ;<br />
useStatement : use [=type:file|url] [location] ;<br />
</pre>

<p>
Above, we have three rules, "directive", "facadeStatement", and "useStatement".  A "directive"
is either a "facadeStatement" or a "useStatement" (the "or" expression is defined by the vertical bar "|").
As indicated earlier, to refer to a rule within another rule, we use double square brackets ("[[" and "]]"). 
</p>

<p>
By default, rule names are added to the tokenization string (the result of parsing the input, shown in blue below).  But, some rules act more like placeholders to help modularize
the grammar (and to promote reuse).  To exclude a rule name (and just the name, the rule itself will still be evaluated 
and tokenized as required), simply add a minus ("-") at the end of its name.
</p>

<p>
Above, we see that the rule names "directive", and "facadeStatement" are not added to the tokenization string because of the trailing minus signs..
</p>

<p>
For example, the text
<font color="green">
"facade;"
</font>
 is tokenized as follows:<br />
<font color="blue">
[facade:facade]
</font>
</p>

<p>
Without the ability to exclude rule names, that same text would be tokenized with the following additional (and unnecessary)
text:<br/>
<font color="blue">
[directive][facadeStatement][facade:facade]
</font>
</p>


&nbsp;<br/>
<h2>Terminal symbols and constants </h2>

<p>Symbols (i.e.terminals), such as "=" and ";" are used in the analysis phase of the parsing (to decide which parsing rule to invoke), but they are not added to the resulting tokenziation string for later processing.
</p>

<p>
If we want to tokenize symbols, we can create a constant using the notation
</p>

<pre class="x">
[=name]  
</pre>


<p>
In the earlier example we see that a "facadeStatement" is represented
by the sequence of characters "facade" (i.e. a constant).
</p>

<p>
To support <i>lists</i> of potential matches we use a 
similar notation
</p>

<pre class="x">
[=name:list|separated|by|bars].
</pre>

<p>
In the earlier example, we see that the "type" non-terminal can be 
the constant string sequence "file" or "url".
</p> 

<p>
Hence, here are a few examples that satisfy the earlier example:
</p>

<ul>
<li><font color="green">facade;</font></li>
<li><font color="green">use file Parser.ump;</font></li>
<li><font color="green">use url http://cruise.site.uottawa.ca/Parser.ump;</font></li>
</ul>




&nbsp;<br>
<h2>Comments and arbitrary input</h2>

<p>
The grammar syntax supports a simple mechanism for non-terminals that can include whitespace (e.g. comments).
Let us consider the rules to define inline and multi-line comments.
</p>

<pre class="x">
inlineComment- : // [*inlineComment]<br />
multilineComment- : /* [**multilineComment] */<br />
</pre>

<p>
The [*name] (e.g. [*inlineComment]) non-terminal will match everything until a newline character.
The [**name] (e.g. [**multilineComment]) non-terminal will match everything (including newlines) until the 
next character sequence is matched.  In the case above, a "multilineComment" will match everything between "/*" and "*/".
</p>

<p>
Here are a few examples that satisfy the assignment rule above:
</p>

<ul>
<li><font color="green">// remove all references to "x" once complete</font></li>
<li><font color="green">/* This class will help calculate<br/> your overdue library fees */</font></li>
</ul>

&nbsp;<br/>
<h2>Special matching cases</h2>

<p>
By default, <font color="red">[name]</font> matches identifiers that can include underscore and certain other symbols. To match alphanumeric identifiers only, then use
</p>

<pre class="x">
[~name]
</pre>

To match based on a regular expression (such as a sequence of one or more digits in this case):

<pre class="x">
[!bound:\d+]
</pre>

<p>
To match one or more identifiers, but with some being optionally omitted use this notation:
</p>

<pre class="x">
[attr_qualifier,attr_type,attr_name>2,1,0]
</pre>

<p>
This states that there will be one, two, or three identifiers.  The
priority of inputs is
attr_name,attr_type and attr_qualifier.
