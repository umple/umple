@@description

<p>A composite structure diagram is used to show how various instances of classes, called <em>parts</em>, are connected at run time in order communicate with each other.<p>

<p>To specify composite structure, the following are the elements that need to be present in an Umple system:</p>

<ul>

<li><b>Classes</b>: Ordinary Umple classes, enhanced to have the items below.

<li><b><a href="Ports.html">Ports</a></b>: (required for a composite structure diagram to be generated) These are special attributes used as the origin and/or destination of data to be transferred among the parts. .

<li><b>Port bindings (Connectors)</b>: These specify how data is to be transferred among the various parts of the system. They connect ports using the -&gt; syntax. Output of one port is transferred to the input of another port.

<li><b><a href="ActiveMethods.html"></b>Active method declarations</a>: These run in their own thread when constructed and are needed to ensure that data is sent and received on the ports without delay.

</ul>

<p>The example below first defines two classes with ports; a third class contains instances of the first two.</p>

<p>Under development: Composite structure diagrams, ports and active methods are currently under development. Code generation only works in C++</p>
