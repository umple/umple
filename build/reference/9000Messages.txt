<h2>General information about Umple errors and warnings</h2>

<p>The subsequent pages in the user manual describe each of the errors or warnings that 
can be emitted by the compiler. These can appear in <a href="UsingUmpleOnline.html"> UmpleOnline</a>, Eclipse and the 
command-line compiler.
</p>

<p>An <b>error</b> is a situation where the compiler can't generate code because the Umple 
code doesn't make sense; i.e. there is something critical missing, or there is an inconsistency.</p>

<p>A <b>warning</b> is a situation where code can be generated, but the resulting system 
may not to have the intended semantics (it may not behave as intended) because of an 
inconsistency, redundancy or assumption that may not be correct.</p>
<br />

<hr>

<p><i>For developers of Umple itself: The file defining the messages in English is called
<a href="https://github.com/umple/umple/blob/master/cruise.umple/src/en.error">
en.error</a> and is  located in cruise.umple/src. Errors have severity 1 or 2, and warnings have severity 3, 4 and 5. When adding a message, a user manual 
page should be added describing it.<br />

All 
messages should be detected in the <a href="https://github.com/umple/umple/blob/master/cruise.umple/src/UmpleInternalParser_CodeClass.ump">parsing phase by calling setFailedPosition</a>.

<br />
It is intended in the future that 
internationalized versions of Umple will be created; for example fr.error would be the 
French version. In the near future, it is intended to enable messages from Java or other 
compilers to be passed through as part of the Umple compilation process; these would be 
the same as the native language compiler, except that line numbers would be changed to 
point to the correct line of Umple code.</i></p>
