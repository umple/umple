@@description

<p> A specialization is a subset of duplicate associations where: <br/>
<ul>
<li> the role names are identical;
<li> the associated types form a hierarchical structure (i.e. the specialized types are subclasses);
<li> and the multiplicites are more specific than that of the previously defined association.
</ul>
</p> 

<p> For example, consider the case of Vehicle and Wheel classes and an Optional One to Many association between them.
A Wheel can only belong to one Vehicle, but the concept of a Vehicle can include any number of Wheels. Say, for instance, we wanted to create a new Bicycle class that extends Vehicle, but we would like to make use of the association that already exists with a stricter multiplicity (say, a Bicycle can have up to 2 Wheels). </p>
&nbsp;<br/>
<p> Without specialiations, we need to create a new association between Bicycle and Wheel and thus generate some unneeded code and duplicate data fields (both Vehicle and Bicycle would have a list of Wheels, which behave more or less the same). With specializations, simply stating that we want a new association between Bicycle and Wheel (as long as the names match up to the Vehicle to Wheel association) is enough to generate more appropriate code.
