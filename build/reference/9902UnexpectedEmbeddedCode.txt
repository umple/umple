Errors and Warnings

<h2>Umple warning reported when embedded code is found in a native language like Java, PHP or C++, yet 'strictness' has been set indicating this should not occur.</h2>

<p>If <a href="StrictnessDirective.html">strictness</a> is set to 'modelOnly', this means that the developer intends to only include classes, associations, state machines and other modeling elements, but not embedded code in another programming language, <a href="MethodDefinition.html">not even method bodies.</a></p>

<p>If <a href="StrictnessDirective.html">strictness</a> is set to 'noExtraCode', it is the same as the above, except that <a href="MethodDefinition.html">method bodies</a> are allowed.</p>

<p>This warning is issued when <a href="StrictnessDirective.html">strictness</a> has been set to one of the above, yet Umple has encountered sytax that interprets as either a method body or some other code in a class that it cannot parse, and is assuming it is native code to be passed to the native compiler.
</p>

<p>This warning can often happen when the programmer/modeler wrote Umple code with a syntax error, so Umple thinks it is not Umple, but some other language. Here are some things to try in order to resolve this warning:<br>
<ul>
<li>Add spaces before and after Umple syntactic elements such as the -&gt; or -- of an association.
<li>Check that you have terminated statements with semicolons where needed.
<li>Ensure your parentheses and quotes match everywhere. An extra or missing { or } can often cause this warning.
<li>Look at the examples of sytax in the user manual pages for such items as <a href="AssociationDefinition.html">associations</a> and <a href="BasicStateMachines.html">state machines</a>, and compare them to what you have provided.
<li>Check <a href="UmpleGrammar.html">the grammar</a> for the elements you are trying to specify in the user manual grammar page.
</ul>
</p>

// The following example shows how to generate this warning.
strictness modelOnly;
class X {
  public static void main() {
    system.out.println("Hello World");
