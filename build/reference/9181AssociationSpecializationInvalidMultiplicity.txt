<h2>Umple error raised when an association specialization has an invalid multiplicity</h2>

<p> 
When performing an Association Specialization, <a href="AssociationSpecializations.html">the multiplicities are more specific than that of the previously defined association.</a>
If the multiplicities on either side of the specialized association are less strict/specific, the association is considered invalid and this error is raised.
<br/><br/>
If you intend to perform specialization, this error can be avoided by narrowing the multiplicity to be more specific than that of the superclass association.
<br/>
If you did not intend to perform specialization, you may have reused a rolename in the association. See <a href="E019DuplicateAssociation.html">E019</a>.
