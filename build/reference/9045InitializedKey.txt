<h2>Umple semantic warning reported when an attribute in the key is given an initial value</h2>

<p>If an attribute is given an initial value and is part of a key, then there is potential for keys of all instances of a class to be the same, meaning that they would be treated as equal and would have the same hash value. It is unlikely that a developer intends for this to be the case, so a warning is thrown to inform them of this behaviour.
