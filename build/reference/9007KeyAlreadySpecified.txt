<h2>Umple semantic warning reported when a second key statement is encountered in a class</h2>

<p>To avoid confusion, a class should normally only have one <a href="KeysforEqualityandHashing.html">key specification</a>. This warning is intended to direct the programmer to list the multiple attributes within the same key directive, rather specifying them separately.</p>

<p>The reason for this is that without this warning, code that is separated by many lines or found in a mixin file might modify the key in a way that wasn't anticipated by the developer who is not aware of the existence of multiple key statements. </p>

<p>Developers can ignore this warning without any consequences. The examples below will generate the same compiled code.
