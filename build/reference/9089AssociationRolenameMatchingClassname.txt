<h2>Umple semantic warning issued when assigning a role to an association that matches the class name</h2>

<p> The role name of an association is used to explain how a class participates in a relationship. 
A role name that matches the class name may be unnecessary, since it provides little clarification as to the relationship between the classes.
<br/>
This warning can be avoided by removing or changing the role name.
<br/><br/>
Note that in certain cases this could raise syntactic errors such as <a href="E019DuplicateAssociation.html">E019</a>.
