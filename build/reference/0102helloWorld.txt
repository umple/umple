@@tooltip Basic examples showing how Umple code is written

@@description
<p>As is customary when introducing a new language, here are some 'hello world' examples for Umple.</p>

<p>The first two examples demonstrate executable Umple programs with embedded Java main programs. Load these examples into UmpleOnline by clicking on the links. The click 'Execute It' to see the output. Or generate Java code by clicking on the 'Generate It' button; then click on the 'download zip file' link and run 'javac' on the result, followed by 'java' on the resulting class file.</p>

<p><b>About the first example below:</b> This contains just Java code and is the same as a plain Java program; it illustrates a key feature of Umple: Umple <i>adds</i> features to existing languages: Code in the original language can and does remain the same. Umple just replaces and simplifies some (or a lot) of it.</p>


<p><b>About the second example below:</b> This shows some very simple features of Umple: An attribute, an association, a generalization, some Java methods and the mixin capability:
<ul>
<li><a href="AttributeDefinition.html">Attributes</a> look very much like variables in Java or other similar programming languages; however they are more than that: Umple generates code for setting and getting each attribute. You can also add lots of other features to attributes, such as making them immutable (so they cannot change), adding constraints, or making them part of a 'key'.</p>
<li>An <a href="AssociationDefinition.html">association</a> such as the one shown here maintains links between objects at run-time. Here the Mentor can find their student(s), and the students can find their optional Mentor.
<li>A <a href="isAclause.html">generalization</a>, as in other object-oriented language, sets up inheritance relationships. Umple uses the 'isA' keyword. Here both Student and Mentor inherit the name attribute.
<li>The <a href="MethodDefinition.html">methods</a> in the example are just normal Java methods. If you generate java from this, compile using javac, and then run the Person class using java, its main program will run.
<li>You will notice that Person is apparently defined twice. This is a feature of Umple called using 'mixin' technology. All the elements are combined to create the resulting class.
</ul>
</p>

<p><b>Umple and UML:</b> Here is the class diagram of the second example in UML. If you click on the 'open in UmpleOnline' link, you will see the UML diagram generated. You can then edit the UML diagram to change the code, or change the code to edit the UML diagram.</p>

<p><b>About the third and fourth examples below:</b> These are the same as the first two examples, except that they contain embedded main programs in Python and C++. After you load these into UmpleOnline, select either Python or C++ from the 'GENERATE' menu, then select 'Generate It'.</p>
