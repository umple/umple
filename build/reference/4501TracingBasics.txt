<p>
Simple tracing is specified using trace directives, which all start with the word 'trace'. This is normally followed by the UML entity to trace (attribute, association, state, etc.).
</p>

<p>
Beyond, this, other clauses can be added to limit tracing to certain conditions, to switch on or off tracing in certain situations, and to specify data that will be output.
</p>

<p>
Each 'trace' statement emits exactly one trace record when something occurs to a matching UML entity; by default it is only <i>changes</i> in value that trigger emission of a trace record, but later pages describe how accesses to the value can also be traced. The format of the trace record will depend on the <a href="Tracers.html">tracer</a> being used but by default will contain the name of the entity and the new value of that entity.

<p>
The following are extremely simple example of tracing using MOTL on a UML Integer attribute. The default console tracer is used, so output will be sent to standard error.
