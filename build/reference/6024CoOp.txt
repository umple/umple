<p>Requirements for a University System to Manage Co-Op Programs</p>

<p>The co-op system works as follows. Employers contact the university and list potential jobs. Each job has a description, employer, location, start and end date, and a list of programs (e.g. SEG, CSI, MCG) for which it is applicable.</p>

<p>Each student in the system has a name, student number, list of available time slots (when they are not in courses, or not doing interviews), resume and transcript.</p>

<p>Students in various programs apply for jobs. Students choose a set of jobs they are interested in. The system shows the list of interested students to employers, and employers pick a set of students to interview. The system sets interview times that match the employee’s and student’s availability (set of available time slots).</p>

<p>At the end of the process, the system arranges for the employer to offer each job to a student. If the first student does not accept, the system arranges for other students (the employer’s second, third choices, etc. ) to be offered the job</p>
