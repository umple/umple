Umplification - An Introduction

@@description
<p>Umplification involves transforming step by step a base language program to an Umple program; each step is a refactoring. The starting point and the ending point of each transformations will be a system
rendered in a textual form combining model elements in the Umple syntax and base language code. </p>

<p>Umplification involves increasing the proportion of modeling
elements. 
</p>

<p>
The key insight is that a pure Java program can be seen as a speci
al case of an Umple program. A pure model can also be seen as such a special case. So Umplification involves repeatedly modifying the Umple to add abstractions, while maintaining the semantics of the
program, and also maintaining to the greatest extent possible
such elements as layout, algorithmic methods and comments
</p>
<p>
Two main features differentiate Umple from existing reverse engineering techniques.
</p>
<ol>
<li> The <b>Tranformations</b> required are intended to be
applie <b>incrementally</b> by a programmer who has a body of legacy code and wants to gradually transform it intoUmple, preserving much of the layout, comments and other aspects of the original code if possible.
</li>
<li> The transformations required are at the same time
<b>code-to-model</b>,<b>model-to-model</b> and <b>code-to-code</b>.
</li>
</ol>
