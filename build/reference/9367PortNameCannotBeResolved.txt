E3607 Missing Class in Association or Port Name Cannot Be Resolved

@@description

<h2>This error can occur in two situations: a semantic error raised when a port name cannot be resolved, or a syntax error caused by an invalid association</h2>

<p>
A port used in a class must be defined before usage by port bindings and
active methods. This is shown in the first example below, with a resolution in the second example.</p>

<p>
This error might also be raised if you intended to write an association from one class to another, but omitted the destination class. This is shown in the third example. The solution would be to add another class and then give the name of that class as the destination of the association.
