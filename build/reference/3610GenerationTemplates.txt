<p>
Generating string output is a very common task for programs. Common types of output include html, xml and executable code. Umple has a special capability for this, as do many other technogies (it is central to PhP, for example). The advantage of Umple&#39;s approach is that it adds generation templates in a uniform manner to C++, Java, PhP and other languages that Umple supports. The same templates can be reused.
</p>

<p>
The Umple generation templates are essentially a readable way to generate special methods that emit Strings (and also in Java&#39;s case StringBuilders).
</p>

<p>
Two basic elements are needed to use generation templates:
</p>



<br/>&nbsp;<br/>
<p>
<b>Templates</b> The first essential element is the templates themselves. These are shown as a name followed by arbitrary text in &lt;&lt;! !&gt;&gt; brackets. The text in the brackets can contain anything you want. See the examples below to understand how these are used.


<p>
<pre>
&lt;&lt;!output this!&gt;&gt;
</pre>
</p>

<p>
will build the string &#39;output this&#39; when specified in an emit method (below).
</p>


<br/>&nbsp;<br/>
<p>
<b>Emit method specifications:</b> The second essential element is one or more &#39;emit&#39; statements. These specify the methods to be generated. As with any method there can be a set of arbitrary parameters. Following this, in a second set of parameters is comma-separated list of templates to emit. For example, the following says to generate a method with signature String printRow(intTimes, intCount); that will emit a string containing the contents of the row and cr templates:
</p>

<p>
<pre>
emit printRow(int times, int count)(row, cr);  
</pre>
</p>

<br/>&nbsp;<br/>
<p>
Optional elements in templates are:
</p>

<p>
<b>Expression blocks:</b> Inside the template, programmers can specify arbitrary expressions in <<= >> brackets. These can refer to attributes of the class, parameters to the emit method, states and so on. The result of the expression will be substituted every time the template method is called. This appears in all examples below.
</p>

<p>
<b>Code blocks:</b> Also inside the template program logic can be embedded in &lt;&lt;# #&gt;&gt; brackets. This enables conditional emission of parts of a template, or looping within the template. This appears in the second example below.
</p>

<p>
<b>Comment blocks:</b> Comments in templates can be shown within &lt;&lt;/* */&gt;&gt;
</p>


<br/>&nbsp;<br/>

<p>
The first two examples below show how simple templates can be used to output strings, in this case a one-column multiplication table. The first example uses two template methods, the second being called in a loop. The second example generates the same output, but all the looping logic is enclosed in the template itself. The third example shows a more substantial template with a lot of 'boilerplate' text that is easy to read and edit in the Umple source. Manually writing the generated would be substantially more awkward.
</p>

<p>
Umple&#39;s mixin capability allows templates to be kept in separate files. This can faciliatate reuse.
