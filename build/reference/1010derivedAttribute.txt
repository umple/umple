@@description
<p>When declaring an attribute in Umple, you can specify at arbitrary expression after the equals sign to create
an attribute that will be computed. There will be no <em>set</em> method on such
an attribute.</p>

<p>Note that unless you use the simplest of expressions, you will be limited
to only being able to generate code for the language of the expression.</p>

<p>You should make sure you call the <em>get</em> methods provided in the Umple-generated
API (rather than directly accessing variables) and avoid having any side-effects in your expressions. Currently this is not enforced, but may be in the future.</p>

<p>For other examples of derived attributes see the sections on the <a href="DelegationPattern.html">Delegation pattern</a> and <a href="SortedAssociations.html">sorted associations</a>.</p>
