<p>
Specifying trace directives at the model level will inject trace points in source code generated from the model. MOTL was designed to collect a wide range of information when tracing is triggered at the execution time. 
</p>
<p>
Collected information includes current system time, thread ID, Object hash code, etc. MOTL tracers will output an initial header to indicate each traced field name.
