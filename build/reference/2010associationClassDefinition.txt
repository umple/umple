@@description
<p>      
An association class defines an object-oriented pattern to manage * -- * (many to many) associations when data needs to be stored about each link of that association.
</p>

<p>An association class is a class and can have most of the items found in an ordinary class. However it
always has two or more 1..many associations to other classes. These are syntactically shown as just a multiplicity (usually *, but 1..* and similar cases are allowed) followed by the name of the participating class (and an optional role name). </p>
