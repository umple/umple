<p><b>Organizing the contents of an Umple (.ump) file</b></p>

<p>An Umple file will contain a number of directives. These can be:

<ul>

<li>Entitles such as <a href="ClassDefinition.html">classes</a> or 
<a href="InterfaceDefinition.html">interfaces</a>. These look very similar to 
the definitions of classes or interfaces in Java. Indeed they can be 
identical to what you would find in a Java (or PHP or Ruby) file. However, 
the key difference is that they can also contain Umple code for UML 
constructs such as <a href="AssociationDefinition.html">associations</a>, <a href="AttributeDefinition.html">attributes</a> and <a href="StateMachineDefinition.html">state machines</a>. Another 
difference is that in Umple, you can have multiple definitions of the same 
class; the contents of the second and subsequent definition are 
<i>added</i> to the overall definition of the class.</li>

<br />

<li><b><a href="UseStatements.html">Use statements</a></b> that direct Umple to include 
other Umple files in the system. It does not matter if you 'use' the same 
file repeatedly.</li>

<br />

<li><b><a href="NamespaceDirectives.html">Namespaces</a></b>. These allow for improved modularization of a 
system.</li>

</ul>

&nbsp;<br />

<p><b>Methods in classes</b></p>

<p>Much of the code in an Umple file is processed by the Umple 
compiler, and used to generate code (in Java, PHP or Ruby) for the final 
system. However <i>methods</i> are treated differently: They are passed 
through essentially unchanged to the resulting system.</p>

<p>If you include methods in Umple code, you therefore have to ensure that 
any give Umple file has methods of just one chosen target language (Java, 
PHP, Ruby).</p>

<p>The resulting system will contain many more methods than those that you 
explicitly include. This is because one of the key points about Umple is 
that it <i>generates</i> a high percentage of the methods you would 
normally need to write by hand if you were programming directly in the 
target language. In other words, when you compile Umple constructs such as 
assocations, attributes and state machines, you are generating many 
methods that you can call; the set of methods you can call is the 
generated API. You can find out the API by using Javadoc, or a similar 
tool, on the generated code.</p>

&nbsp;<br />

<p><b>Organizing a system containing many files</b></p>

<p>If your system is large, you should divide it into many files. One way 
to do this is to follow the Java convention of having one .ump file per 
class. Another common approach is to have one or more files for the model 
code (just the pure UML elements such as classes with their attributes, 
associations and state machines) and separate files for the methods; you 
can in fact have some files for Java methods, and other files for PHP or 
Ruby methods. The same model can then be used to deveop systems that are 
deplpyed in multiple base languages.</p>

<p>The fact that Umple allows for multiple definitions to be added to 
create a complete definition, also means that you can create 
<i>mixins</i>. A mixin is a file that has some definitions that can be 
added to add extra features to a system. You can therefore organize your 
system, in whole or in part, by <i>feature</i>. The various pieces of code 
needed to implement a feature (including entire new classes, or bits such 
as associations and methods to add to existing classes), can be therefore 
be grouped together. There are limits to this, however: At the current 
time, this mechanism does not allow you to override existing elememts, 
which you might need to do to add a feature. Taken together, these 
mechanisms allow for a form of product-line development. Umple does, 
however, have an extra feature, called <a 
href="http://cruise.site.uottawa.ca/umpleonline/vml.php">VML</a> that should assist with this when complete.</p>
