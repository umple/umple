@@description

<h2>Umple semantic warning reported when a singleton class has an
association with a multiplicity lower bound of 1 at the other end of the association</h2>

<p>The constructor of a singleton can't take any arguments. Therefore it can't have a required link to another object, since this would have to be specified in the constructor. Any associations to other classes should therefore have multiplicity with lower bound of zero.

</p>

<p>Note: Conceptually this warning would also have been  produced if the lower bound was something
greater than 1 (e.g. 5). However Umple treats a multiplicity specified with a lower bound > 1 as if the multiplicity lower bound was 0. The programmer is supposed to add the n elements immediately after construction. The API has a validity check method to verify this has been done.
