<p>  Alternatively, all classes can be forbidden to be distributable by using the following directive: <br><br> </p> 

<pre>  distributable off; <br><br> </pre> 

<p>  One can use Web services instead of RMI by adding ws after distributable keyword in the class: <br><br> </p> 

<pre> distributable WS; </pre>

<p>Note: Web services is not currently working due to an issue with outdated dependencies.</p>
