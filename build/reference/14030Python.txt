<p>
The Python generator in Umple allows you to embed Python code in Umple. Almost everything that can be generated by the Umple Java generator is also available:  TXL transformation technology is used to convert generated Java to Python.</p>

<p>The Python generator also works on the command line, but if you are generating Python on the command line you need to install <a target="txl" href="https://www.txl.ca">version 10.8b of FreeTXL</a> first.</p>

<p>To create a Main function, follow the the last two <a href="HelloWorldExamples.html">Hello World examples</a> for some tips. Specify <code>public static void main(String [ ] args) {  </code> followed on subsequent lines by Python code, followed by a <code>}</code></li>

<p>Currently Python code cannot be executed in UmpleOnline.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Aspect oriented code Injection.</li>
</ul>
