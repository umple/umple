<p>
Given a class diagram described in umple the instance diagram generator will create a valid random instance diagram from the class diagram.</p>

<br/>

<p><b> Instance names and ids</b></p>

<p>If the first attribute of a class is a String name then the name of the instance will be match the randomly generated attribute value.</p>
<p>If the first attribute of a class is id or ends in Id (case sensitive such as productId and not cupid) the instance name will be className + id</p>

<p><b> Possible Errors</b></p>

 <ul>
  <li>1. Reached maximum iterations. Ensure that the system is instantiable and non-infinite</li>
  <li>2. Reached maximum class count. Ensure that the system is instantiable and non-infinite</li>
  <li>3. Inheritance unresolvable. Ensure that all abstract/interface classes have concrete implementations that can be instantiated</li>
  <li>4. Infinite loop detected. Instantiating the following classes will lead to an infinite number of instances: (list of classes)</li>
</ul>
