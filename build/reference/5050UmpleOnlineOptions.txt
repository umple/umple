@@description
<p>UmpleOnline allows you to append various options to its URLi, enabling
startup in a certain state. These are preceded by an ampersand, except the first
in a list which would be preceded by a question mark.</p>

<ul>

<li>?nochrome: Hide the header of the UmpleOnline page (sometimes called the chrome) so only the model is visible.<p>

<li>?nodiagram: Don't show any diagram, in order to show the text only.<p>

<li>?diagramtype=GvClass: By default show graphviz class diagrams instead of editable diagrams.<p>

<li>?diagramtype=state: By default show graphviz state diagrams instead of editable class diagrams.<p>

<li>?notext: Don't show Umple text (doesn't have any effect if the diagram is also hidden).<p>

<li>?nomenu: Hide the middle menu. Either ?notext or ?nodiagram must also be present.<p>

<li>?readOnly: Turn off editing capability - use for display only.<p>

<li>?filename=xxxxx: Load the model xxxxx. xxxxx is a URL with the leading https:// left off.<p>

<li>?showlayout: Show a pane with information about where each class should appear in a class diagram. This is normally hidden (it cam be manually displayed from the Other Options menu). This can be used to finely tune the layout; after adjusting the layout the user should then make a small change to the main text (e.g. just add and delete a space) to force the diagram to update).<p>

<li>?displayoptions=xxxxx: Pre-filter the diagram or request a specific layout algorithm, a specific filters or a mixset activation. The options specified in the xxxxx here are the same that can be specified in the "Show and Hide" text field. Some options only work with specific diagram types such as gvClass. Examples include gvmanual to enable manual layout, or a class name to filter on this class. You can separate multiple items with spaces, but the code %20 would be safer in the URL format than using a space. If you are including an integer as part of the displayoptions, to include connected classes in a filter, then place this first.<p>

<li>?generateDefault=xxx: Set the generate menu to by default show a particular choice. The default is Java. Other options in include python, cpp, ruby, php, alloy<p>

</ul>
