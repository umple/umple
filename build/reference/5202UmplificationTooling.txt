<p>
The <b> Umplificator </b> is a reverse engineering tool for the incremental automatic detection of opportunities for refactorings and model transformations in source code consisting of Umple or an Umple base language such as Java. 
</p>
<p>To transform a program written in Java into Umple you can use one of the following tools: </p>
<ul>

<li><b>Eclipse</b>: To use the Umplificator with Eclipse, you need to load the the Umplificator plugin (cruise.umplificator.eclipse.X.X.X.jar). This can be obtained from our <a href="http:/dl.umple.org">downloads site</a>. </li>
<br />

<li><b>Command-line based compiler</b>: You can use the Umplificator from the command line.  Simply download the latest officially released version of the <a href=""http:/dl.umple.org"> umplificator jar</a>, and run it as "java -jar umplificator.jar *.java". </li>
Note that it is also possible to umplify files with extension ".ump". 
</ul>
