#Common templates

This directory is intended to contain templates that are common among the various UmpleTo*
directories.

As of the time of writing there are no common templates as we are in the process of moving away from Jet
to UmpleTL. Any common UmpleTL templates should be put in the UmpleTLTemplates directory if they are
ever created. Any jet templates will be removed.

The templates that might be considerd putting back here include

* association_Get_All
* association_Set_All
* attribute_Get_All
* attribute_IsBoolean_All
* attribute_Set_All
* state_machine_Events_All
* state_machine_Get_All
* state_machine_Set_All
