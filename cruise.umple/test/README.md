Overview of where to find tests in Umple

Umple has several categories of tests:

1. Core unit and system tests
   See from the top level the directory: cruise.umple/test/cruise/umple
   See ant file build/build.umple.xml

1a. Tests of compiler syntax, parsing and error generation
   These are in subdirectories cruise/umple/parser, compiler and others in that level
   
1b. Tests that generated output appears correctly
   These are in subdirectory cruise/umple/implementation
    In this, there are .java files that run the junit tests of this type
    And there are .ump files that are the input to the tests
      There is a deeper subdirectory for each langauge (java, py, etc.)
      These contain .txt files with output the generated by that generator for each test

2. Tests of execution of generated code
   See the 'testbed' directory at the top level for Java 
   See ant file build/build.testbed.xml (also see build.gradle


3. Tests of all the examples in UmpleOnline and the user manual
   The examples can be found in umpleonline/umplibrary/
   We generate code from all the examples (with filters where it is not appropriate) and compile or lint them
   see ant file build/build.exampletests.xml
