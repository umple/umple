This file is an Umple translation of a model
of C version 1.0 found at the following URL

Domain: Programming language

Description: This metamodel describes C which is a standardized imperative computer programming language developed in the early 1970s by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie for use on the UNIX operating system. It has since spread to many other operating systems, and is one of the most widely used programming languages. C is prized for its efficiency, and is the most popular programming language for writing system software, though it is also used for writing applications. It is also commonly used in computer science education, despite not being designed for novices. This simplified metamodel describes a subset of the C language.
