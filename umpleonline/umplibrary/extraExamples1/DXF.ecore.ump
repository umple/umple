Description : This metamodel describes geometrical data in DXF (Drawing eXchange Format) which is the native vector file format of Autodesk s AutoCAD CAD application. This simplified DXF metamodel has an aggregation hierarchy. It consists of one DXF element that contains a number of Meshes (a 3D object based on a set of contiguous lines) which in turn consist of a number of Points (two consecutive points represent a line). Meshes and Points have names. Points have three coordinates, namely x, y and z.
