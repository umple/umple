Domain : Ontology

Description : This metamodel describes a subset of the Core Plan Representation (CPR) which is an effort to construct a general plan ontology. It has been developed to support the common plan representation of military planning, workflow and simulation. CPR is a DARPA project that mainly focuses on planning (specifying an action list in order to deal with a set of objectives) as well as on foreseeing (specifying moments at which activities will be realized and resource quantities will be used).
