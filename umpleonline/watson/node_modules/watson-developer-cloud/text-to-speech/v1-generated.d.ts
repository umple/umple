/**
 * ### Service Overview The IBM&reg; Text to Speech service provides APIs that use IBM's speech-synthesis capabilities to synthesize text into natural-sounding speech in a variety of languages, dialects, and voices. The service supports at least one male or female voice, sometimes both, for each language. The audio is streamed back to the client with minimal delay.   For speech synthesis, the service supports a synchronous HTTP Representational State Transfer (REST) interface. It also supports a WebSocket interface that provides both plain text and SSML input, including the SSML &lt;mark&gt; element and word timings. SSML is an XML-based markup language that provides text annotation for speech-synthesis applications.   The service also offers a customization interface. You can use the interface to define sounds-like or phonetic translations for words. A sounds-like translation consists of one or more words that, when combined, sound like the word. A phonetic translation is based on the SSML phoneme format for representing a word. You can specify a phonetic translation in standard International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) representation or in the proprietary IBM Symbolic Phonetic Representation (SPR).

     * @param {string} [options.url] - The base url to use when contacting the service (e.g. 'https://gateway.watsonplatform.net/text-to-speech/api'). The base url may differ between Bluemix regions.
     * @param {string} [options.username] - The username used to authenticate with the service. Username and password credentials are only required to run your application locally or outside of Bluemix. When running on Bluemix, the credentials will be automatically loaded from the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable.
     * @param {string} [options.password] - The password used to authenticate with the service.

     * @param {string} [options.iam_apikey] - An API key that can be used to request IAM tokens. If this API key is provided, the SDK will manage the token and handle the refreshing.
     * @param {string} [options.iam_url] - An optional URL for the IAM service API. Defaults to 'https://iam.bluemix.net/identity/token'.
     * @param {boolean} [options.use_unauthenticated] - Set to `true` to avoid including an authorization header. This option may be useful for requests that are proxied.

Logging is done only to improve the services for future users. The logged data is not shared or made public. If you are concerned with protecting the privacy of users' personal information or otherwise do not want your requests to be logged, you can opt out of logging.

     * ### Audio formats (accept types)
     *
     *  The service can return audio in the following formats (MIME types).
     * * Where indicated, you can optionally specify the sampling rate (`rate`) of the audio. You must specify a sampling
     * rate for the `audio/l16` and `audio/mulaw` formats. A specified sampling rate must lie in the range of 8 kHz to 192
     * kHz.
     * * For the `audio/l16` format, you can optionally specify the endianness (`endianness`) of the audio:
     * `endianness=big-endian` or `endianness=little-endian`.
     *
     * Use the `Accept` header or the `accept` parameter to specify the requested format of the response audio. If you
     * omit an audio format altogether, the service returns the audio in Ogg format with the Opus codec
     * (`audio/ogg;codecs=opus`). The service always returns single-channel audio.
     * * `audio/basic`
     *
     *   The service returns audio with a sampling rate of 8000 Hz.
     * * `audio/flac`

     *
     *   You can optionally specify the `rate` of the audio. The default sampling rate is 22,050 Hz.
     * * `audio/ogg;codecs=vorbis`
     *
     *   You can optionally specify the `rate` of the audio. The default sampling rate is 22,050 Hz.
     * * `audio/wav`
     *
     *   You can optionally specify the `rate` of the audio. The default sampling rate is 22,050 Hz.

     *
     * ### Warning messages
     *
     *  If a request includes invalid query parameters, the service returns a `Warnings` response header that provides
     * messages about the invalid parameters. The warning includes a descriptive message and a list of invalid argument
     * strings. For example, a message such as `\"Unknown arguments:\"` or `\"Unknown url query arguments:\"` followed by
     * a list of the form `\"{invalid_arg_1}, {invalid_arg_2}.\"` The request succeeds despite the warnings.
