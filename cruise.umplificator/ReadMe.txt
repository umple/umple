cruise.umplificator is the core directory for the source code of the Umplificator.

Items marked *** are created by the build process only and are not version controlled.
They are referenced here so that people can better understand the hierarchy of files whether or not they have built the system. Never modify these files and never commit them to version control.

Items marked * are generated by the build process, but are version controlled as well. The reason for this is that we build Umple with itself, and we want to be able to always compile Umple with an earlier stable version of the compiler. Never modify any of these items.

Subdirectories:

    bin ***
      Contains .class files as produced by Java, plus some other data files that
      are copied over from other directories.
      
    src
      Umple code for the Umplificator,
      IMPORTANT: Umple is written in itself. Add new files here
      and give them .ump suffices
      This is the most important directory in the system.

           
    src-gen-umple
       * Code generated by by Umple itself for Umple. Never to be modified

    src/main/resources
       * Contains .drl files. These are the rules used to specify the mappings in the umplificator.
    test
       All the unit tests (and test files) for the umplificator.

Notes: log4j2.xml is used to configure the Logger.
